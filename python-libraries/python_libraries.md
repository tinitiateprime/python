# Python Libraries
* Libraries in Python are collections of pre-written code that users can include in their projects to perform various tasks without needing to write code from scratch.
* They encapsulate common operations, complex algorithms, and advanced functionalities, allowing developers to focus on writing application-specific code without reinventing the wheel.
* These libraries can provide a wide range of functionalities, such as data manipulation, numerical computations, graphics, web development, and more.

## Types of Python Libraries
* Python libraries can be categorized into several types based on their purposes but in general standard and third-party:
### Standard Library:
* Python’s standard library comes with the Python distribution(In-built).
* It includes modules for system-specific parameters, file I/O, networking, os, sys, math, datetime, json and many other functionalities.
### Third-Party Libraries:
* These are created by the community, can be installed via package managers like pip.
* It includes numpy, pandas, requests, flask, django, etc.
### Custom Libraries:
* Developed by individuals or organizations for specific purposes or projects.

## Module vs Package vs Library
* Modules, packages, and libraries in Python are related concepts but differ in their scope and structure.

**Here's a breakdown of each:**
### Module
* A module in Python is a single file containing Python code that can include functions, classes, or variables. A module is the smallest unit of code organization in Python, and it is designed to be reusable by other modules or scripts. You can import a module into your script to access its functionalities. For example, a file named math_operations.py that defines several math-related functions can be considered a module.
### Package
* A package is a collection of Python modules under a common namespace. In practice, this means that a package is a directory containing one or more modules (Python files), along with a special file called `__init__.py`. The presence of `__init__.py` indicates to Python that this directory should be treated as a package. This structure allows for organizing modules in a hierarchical manner, which is beneficial for larger projects. For example, a package called financial_tools might contain modules for budgeting, investing, and taxes.
### Library
* A library is a more general term that refers to a collection of packages or modules that are used to develop software. Libraries provide a set of functionalities and are not limited to Python; they can exist in any programming language. In Python, a library might include a set of packages that work together to provide specific functionality or capabilities, such as NumPy or Pandas for data analysis. Libraries are designed to help developers by providing pre-written code that they can use to enhance their applications, save time, and add more complex features without starting from scratch.
### Summary:
```python
# "File = module, Folder = package, Collection = library"
```
*  A module is a single `.py` Python file you can `import`.
```
import csv → csv.py inside the standard library
```
*  A package is a folder/directory that contains a collection of modules with a `__init__.py` file.
```
import email → that’s a package with many submodules like email.mime, email.parser
```
*  A library is a collection of related functionality encapsulated in packages and modules, which can sometimes include software in other languages or even compiled binaries.
```
pip install requests → requests is a library made up of several modules and packages
```
* These concepts are fundamental in Python for code reuse, organization, and distribution. By understanding the differences, you can better organize your own projects and understand how to use external code effectively.

## Conclusion
* Python libraries are powerful tools that extend the capabilities of Python and enable developers to build complex applications efficiently.
* By leveraging standard and third-party libraries, developers can focus on creating innovative solutions without getting bogged down by implementing basic functionality from scratch.
