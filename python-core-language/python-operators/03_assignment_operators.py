# Assignment
a = 10
print(a)  # Output: 10

# Addition assignment
a += 5    # Equivalent to a = a + 5
print(a)  # Output: 15

# Subtraction assignment
a -= 3    # Equivalent to a = a - 3
print(a)  # Output: 12

# Multiplication assignment
a *= 2    # Equivalent to a = a * 2
print(a)  # Output: 24

# Division assignment
a /= 4    # Equivalent to a = a / 4
print(a)  # Output: 6.0

# Modulus assignment
a %= 5    # Equivalent to a = a % 5
print(a)  # Output: 1.0

# Floor Division assignment
a //= 2   # Equivalent to a = a // 2
print(a)  # Output: 0.0

# Exponentiation assignment
a **= 3   # Equivalent to a = a ** 3
print(a)  # Output: 0.0 (0 to the power of 3 is still 0)
